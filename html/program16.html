        Game of Craps simulation
    </h1>
    <p>Write a C++ program that simulates the casino game of Craps. These are the rules of the game:
    </p>
    <p>• If a player throws a 7 or 11 (sum of two dice) on the first roll, the player wins the game.
    </p>
    <p>• If a player throws a 2, 3 or 12 (sum of two dice) on the first roll, the player loses the game.
    </p>
    <p>• If a player throws a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 (sum of two dice) on the first roll, the player neither wins nor loses but creates a “point.” If this is the case, the player keeps rolling the dice until the point (4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10) is thrown again,
        and the player wins the game. However, if the player throws a 7 (sum of two dice) before the “point” is thrown, the player loses the game.</p>
