        Game of blackjack
    </h1>
    <p>
        In the game of blackjack, the cards 2 through 10 are counted at their face values, regardless of suit; all face cards (jack, queen, and king) are counted as 10; and an ace is counted as a 1 or 11, depending on the total count of all cards in a player’s
        hand. The ace is counted as 11 only if the resulting total value of all cards in a player’s hand doesn’t exceed 21; otherwise, it’s counted as 1. Using this information, write a C++ program that accepts three card values as inputs (a 1 corresponding
        to an ace, a 2 corresponding to a two, and so on), calculates and display the total value of the hand, and the sum of the three cards.
